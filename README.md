Welcome to the *Introduction to Python* course for React CDT students.

In the first three sessions, we will be working with materials from the Software Carpentry resource for scientific computing:
http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/

A bit of set-up before the session: it would be helpful if you are able to install JupyterLab to work with Jupyter notebooks. The easiest option is to install the Anaconda environment, which includes both Python and JupyterLab:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

A video giving installation instructions for different platforms is available here: http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup.html
(You don’t need to download the data file mentioned on this page.)

If you aren’t able to install Anaconda on your machine, an alternative is to work with JupyterLab online, using this link to the Binder resource:

## Further Learning

This course gives a basic introduction to the Python programming language, which should be enough to get you started with your own learning.

* [Think Python 2e](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is an excellent introductory textbook, available for free online.
* The follow-on [Python Bridge](https://github.com/johnpinney/python_bridge) course will introduce you to the most important components of the *SciPy* libraries (numpy, pandas and matplotlib). 
* Check out other [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) lessons, in particular
	*  [Errors and Exceptions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/09-errors/index.html)
	*  [Debugging](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/11-debugging/index.html)
	*  [Command-Line Programs](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/12-cmdline/index.html)
* The [Graduate School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/courses/) offers several other intermediate- and advanced-level Python courses.
